## Architecture ‚öíÔ∏è‚Ää

* **Architecture Pattern**:
	
	I used the MVVM architecture pattern, because I think it has the perfect balance between order and functionality for a small-medium sized project.

* **API Calls**:
	
	I used the asynchronous (async await) way to implement the API calls, I prefer to manage all the network calls by myself to know exactly what i do and how i do everything.
	
	Also exists another branch with all the networking with callbacks but i decided to change this to improve the code and the functionality of the app, but you can take a look.

* **UI**:
	
	I used XIBs to design the UI, I choose that way because i think it's the best way to manage the UI in an iOS app (disregarding SwiftUI) and it's also the most popular way to do it.
	
	I also design a couple of views programmatically when it's necessary.

## Libraries üìö

I have used CocoaPods for dependency manager. 

* lottie-ios, to renders vector-based animations.
