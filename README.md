# Astro Data

## About üì±

The goal of this project was to learn how to make a complete app by myself using the best programming techniques and improve my level during the project, also to have something big and interesting in my portfolio, so you can see the way I make apps!

Astro Data is an app for iOS with which you can explore all the official information that NASA has by calling its official API!, the name of the project was InfoSpace in the past, so you can see some references to this name in the code, I have updated it to Astro Data which is better, I think!

If you have something interesting, like tips on how to improve something specific, bugs, interesting proposals or anything else don't hesitate to contact me, you will find my official networks in my github profile info!

## Architecture ‚öíÔ∏è‚Ää

* **Architecture Pattern**:
	
	I used the MVVM architecture pattern, because I think it has the perfect balance between order and functionality for a small-medium sized project.

* **API Calls**:
	
	I used the asynchronous (async await) way to implement the API calls, I prefer to manage all the network calls by myself to know exactly what i do and how i do everything.
	
	Also exists another branch with all the networking with callbacks but i decided to change this to improve the code and the functionality of the app, but you can take a look.

* **UI**:
	
	I used XIBs to design the UI, I choose that way because i think it's the best way to manage the UI in an iOS app (disregarding SwiftUI) and it's also the most popular way to do it.
	
	I also design a couple of views programmatically when it's necessary.

## Libraries üìö

I have used CocoaPods for dependency manager. 

* lottie-ios, to renders vector-based animations.
* Firebase, to Analytics and Crashlytics.
